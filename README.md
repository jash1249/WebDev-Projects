# Landing Page
WebDev-Projects - Internship Projects
A Landing Page is a common yet powerful project for beginner web developers. It helps in understanding the core structure of HTML and styling techniques with CSS.

This project involved:
1. Creating structured sections using HTML (headers, footers, columns, content blocks)
   
2. Styling the layout with CSS for padding, margin, alignment, color palette, and typography
   
3. Organizing visual elements like buttons, boxes, and banners for a clean and professional design

4. Ensuring all components are aligned and non-overlapping with careful use of CSS positioning

This project boosted my creative skills by challenging me to design a visually appealing and functional landing page while applying foundational concepts of web development.
